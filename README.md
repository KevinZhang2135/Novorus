# Novorus

## Overview
Novorus is a fun personal project made during highschool from Python and the Pygame library. It is largely an interesting exercise to apply computer science principles such objected oriented programming and user I/O. However, the game has many shortcomings due to its design. While it used inheritance to control the numerous entities encountered in the game, many other Game engines prefer to use Finite-State Machines which are far more flexible in terms of behavior and transitions. Entity collisions with surfaces are also not very precise and occasionally phase through barriers. Nonetheless, Novorus was a valuable experience in coding a game from ground-up without the vast libraries provided by well-known game engines, allowing me to better understand the how such physics and mechanisms are implemented.
